## Introduction

I was a Hotel Revenue Manager with Marriott International for five years, and was always curious about the inner-workings of the revenue management systems employed there. The COVID-19 pandemic provided me the opportunity to delve into programming and Data Science. Fast forward one year, and I'm now approaching the end of the 12-week Metis Data Science Bootcamp, and our fifth (and final) project is the 'Passion Project'. I wanted to combine my newly acquired knowledge with the old into the creation of a revenue management system.

For an in-depth description of the project, take a look at my blog post.
