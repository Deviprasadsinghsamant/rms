## Introduction

I was a Hotel Revenue Manager with Marriott for five years, and was always curious about the inner-workings of the revenue management systems employed there. The COVID-19 pandemic provided me the opportunity to delve into Data Science. I'm now approaching the end of the 12-week Metis Data Science Bootcamp, and our fifth (and final) project is the 'Passion Project'. I wanted to combine my newly acquired knowledge with the old into the creation of a revenue management system.

Since the results of this project had to be be made public, I feared I wouldn't be able to find a dataset. I had almost selected a different problem to work on when I found a fully anonymous dataset containing reservation-level hotel data for two European hotels.

## Dataset

The dataset contains a sample of reservations for both H1 (Hotel 1, resort hotel) and H2 (Hotel 2, city hotel). The sample contained all reservations that touched the hotel nights of July 1, 2015 - August 31, 2017, including cancelled reservations. The hotel and guest information were anonymized, and the only contextual hotel information we have is the hotel type (resort/city).

There were 40,060 reservations for H1 and 79,330 reservations for H2. For more information about the dataset, see the source website ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191)).
